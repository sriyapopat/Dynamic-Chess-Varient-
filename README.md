# Dynamic-Chess-Varient-
♟️ Chess Engine in Python
A Python-based chess engine featuring a graphical interface built with Pygame and an AI opponent powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning. This project simulates a full chess game experience for human vs. AI gameplay.

🚀 Features
Fully functional chess game
Single-player mode against AI
Legal move generation and validation
Special moves: castling, en passant, pawn promotion
Undo and reset functionality
Modular and maintainable codebase
GUI built using Pygame

🧠 AI Implementation
Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
Evaluation function based on material and positional advantage
Adjustable search depth for difficulty tuning
Strategic decision-making (trades, forks, pins, checks)
